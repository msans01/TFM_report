The costs associated to the project are those that have to bee counted for the contract with Redeia, which considering it is an open-source implementation, only consider the consultancy workforce of the employees working on the project. In 
this case, there has been one full-time development engineer and one part-time supervisor (10-hour week). 
From Figure \ref{fig:gantt} we can see that the project has lasted 32 weeks, although only 26 of them can be considered as working weeks of the project since the documentation
work is outside of the contract.
The complete costs are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:equip}.
