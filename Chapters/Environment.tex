The present chapter considers the impact that this project has in the society.

\subsection{Environmental Impact}

The environmental impact of this project is positive, as it contributes to the development of a tool that will help to optimize the Spanish electrical grid. This optimization will allow the grid to operate more efficiently, 
reducing the amount of energy that is wasted and minimizing the environmental impact of the grid. By optimizing the grid, it will be possible to reduce the amount of energy that is generated from fossil fuels, which will help 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. In addition, the optimization of the grid will help to reduce the amount of energy that is lost during transmission, which will help to reduce the overall energy 
consumption of the grid. This will help to reduce the environmental impact of the grid and contribute to the development of a more sustainable energy system.

\subsection{Social Impact}

The social impact of this project is also positive, as it will help to improve the reliability and stability of the Spanish electrical grid. By optimizing the grid, it will be possible to reduce the risk of blackouts and
improve the overall reliability of the grid. This will help to ensure that the grid can meet the energy needs of the population and provide a reliable source of electricity. In addition, the optimization of the grid will help
to reduce the cost of electricity for consumers, as it will help to reduce the amount of energy that is wasted and improve the overall efficiency of the grid. This will help to reduce the financial burden on consumers and
contribute to the development of a more sustainable energy system.
