\subsection{Further Work}

The solver holds a lot of potential for enhancement, with many possible improvements of the existing features as well as future additions of new functionalities. Some of the 
future works that are being discussed are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Related to raw performance, some intermediate calculations for the gradients and Hessians could be optimized to reduce the time needed to solve the problem. This involves using the sparse structures 
    used in the process of creating the Jacobian and Hessian matrices, although it is not a trivial task and requires a deep understanding of the data structure involved.
